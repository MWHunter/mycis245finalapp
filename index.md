# Random chess app

Welcome to the random chess app webpage!  Here we have a few things:
- A revolutionary new chess engine from scratch with a depth of... 0.5 moves.  This is balanced by mutations however:
  - A higher number of mutations means more moves are played before the game begins
  - Sometimes you get unlucky with a bad position and have no chance at winning
  - Sometimes you get a really good position
- A global highscore system
- Saving the number of mutations that the user selects
- You can spam new game without breaking anything


## Audience
Gamers.


## Challenges
Data storage was difficult without the use of objects.  It works for everything the app needs to do, however.


## Successes
Sometimes the engine is lucky and plays a good move, it has beaten me a few times
